In the first visualization we see how long Users checkout bikes. Followed with the second one which shows the checkout times by gender. Gender Breakdown using a piechart. Average trip duration by age using an area chart. Trips by weekday by the hour as well as by the gender use a heatmap.

## Summary
Looking over the following charts. The majority of the users are male, with a recent rise in their 20's. However the length of the trips seem to fall under an hour with a good amount on the weekends and early morning and afternoon. A helpful visualization for the future would be the age demographic in a pie chart to keep the focus on that demographic or potentially a graph showing the starting and stopping locations by age, to potentially avoid school zones, where more students will be using the bike share.
